# Schedulerust

## What it is?

Schedulerust is a CLI app to create schedules based on slots you have available
and activities you wanna do in these slots.

## Motivation

In a semester at uni, I had a problem choosing the courses to take, because
it was hard to see which courses that didn't have classes at the same time. So
I came up with the idea for schedulerust to help me build all the possible schedules
so I could choose which one I would choose.

## todo!()

- [ ] Create user interface
- [ ] Add option for create schedules without a specified amount of activites the user wants to attend
